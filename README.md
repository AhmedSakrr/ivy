    ivy - A large botnet written in C and Golang.
</h1>
<p align="center">
    Ivy is a large, feature-rich botnet written in C and Golang that contains a built-in loader for parsing data
    from wordlists, and bruting devices to send payloads. Ivy's bot contains all the base features
    for a bot, and a command handling function that the user is able to edit, for their own use.

## Features
Feature  | Description
-------- | -----------
Anti VM | The bot for Ivy checks if it's being ran in a virtual machine by checking for the uptime and hardware specifications. If it detects anything suspicious, it exits.
Anti Debug | The bot for Ivy checks if it's being debugged. If it is, it exits.
Loader | Ivy has a built-in loader that can brute and send payloads to devices via ADB, SSH, and Telnet.
Command Execution | You can send data to all the connected devices.
Configuration | Ivy makes it extremely easy to configure the loader, bot, and C2.
